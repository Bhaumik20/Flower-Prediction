Flower class prediction using Iris dataset.
Iris dataset consist of 150 samples of flowers of 3 species(classes) named Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. This dataset contains 4 features for each
flower - Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width visit this [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) for more info.

This Web app is built using FLask framework in python language. And uses tensorflow keras API for training flower prediction model.
